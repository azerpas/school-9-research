\section{Introduction}
Cryptocurrencies have become tremendously famous nowadays. Whether the appeal is technology, gains, or freedom, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have become a subject of controversies and regulations in a lot of countries. Their environmental impact has been the center of criticism for a few years already and while a lot of studies reflect that \textit{Proof-Of-Work} algorithms consume tons of energy, these cryptocurrencies are still at the top of any trading platform. 

However, legions of new blockchains are created everyday with the same goal,  become more energy efficient, scalable, and interoperable. Few of them make it to the stage of being actually used. While energy prices are rising up to unmatched levels, mining farms are still operating at full speed and authorities, in their need of saving up energy power, are starting to investigate this activity.  

Whereas Ethereum started to transiting to a new consensus algorithm: \textit{Proof-Of-Stake}, and some other new blockchains like Solana or Near are flowing into the market with strong environmental values, we can wonder how blockchains will shift to some more environmental-friendly technology and sustain in the long term.


\section{Bitcoin and the proof-of-work}

As we said earlier, Bitcoin remains the most popular \textit{Proof-Of-Work} blockchain, if not the most popular blockchain of all. 

\subsection{Bitcoin}

Bitcoin find its roots in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto released the first open-source version. This digital currency use a ledger called blockchain to store all of the transactions which are represented by cryptographic hashes. To verify the integrity of these transactions, the network is composed of nodes which all can verify the validity of each new block, with the latest containing multiple transactions.

\subsection{Proof-Of-Work and Decentralization}

One of the strengths of \textit{Bitcoin} and its \textit{Proof-Of-Work} system is its resistance to attacks. 
\begin{pf}  
You would need to take possession of 51\% of the active nodes to corrupt the network, which at the time of this writing accounts for at least 130 millions terrahash/s. To achieve this, you would need 1,3 millions Antminer S19 Pro (the current best ASIC Bitcoin Miner on the market) with each producing 100 TH/s, at a whooping total price of 19 billions dollars. And this is excluding the price of the electricity required to run the miners, with each consuming 3250W, the individual cost would be 10\$/day each.
\end{pf}

As observed, the energy required to attack the Bitcoin network is enormous.
This energy consumption is at least making Bitcoin the most transparent and decentralized currency in the world. And that is why, in its almost 14 years of existence, Bitcoin hasn't shifted to another form of consensus. The community around this blockchain is concerned by this decentralization that there haven't been any progress made towards some other consensus which could possibly fragilize Bitcoin.

 The estimated total global energy usage for Bitcoin is 168 billion kilowatt-hours per year at highest, which is between 0.4 to 0.9\% of the total global annual electricity usage in the world or more than 50\% of the energy used by all of the datacenters in the world, see \cite{TowGreen:21}.

However, in recent years, there has been a pursuit of a more sustainable computer science, especially concerning the green coding and the effects of the results. Concerns about the \textit{Proof-Of-Work} consensus have been \textit{Ethereum}.

\section{Ethereum and the Proof-Of-Stake}

Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a project aiming to bring programming to the blockchain. Today it is the blockchain that has the most value locked in dollars, which implies that it is also the most used. Until weeks ago, the \textit{Proof-Of-Work} consensus was used to ensure the security of the blockchain. What has change?

\subsection{Smart Contracts}
Smart Contracts are programs that are able to store states and interact with it on the blockchain. Ethereum was the first to made it possible through and also the first to create programming languages, Solidity, Vyper, that can interact with EVM, the Ethereum Virtual Machine. While Solidity is very strong and supports most of the functionnalities that classic programming languages support, it also brings a lot of security concerns. At the time of writing this article, Ethereum TVL (\textit{Total Locked Value}) is 25 billion dollars with a maximum reached in Nov. 2021 of 100 billion dollars, see \citep[reference.][]{DefiLlama:22}.

As we said earlier on, \textit{Proof-Of-Work} consensus was used until very recently on Ethereum blockchain. Ensuring that the only way to hack your way around the network was to overpower the network, and as we saw we Bitcoin, it proves itself very tricky. 

But in 2022, Ethereum chose to drift from \textit{Proof-Of-Work} to use a new well-known consensus algorithm \textit{Proof-Of-Stake}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Salut
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:sample}
{{\partial F}\over {\partial t}} = D{{\partial^2 F}\over {\partial x^2}}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Example.} This equation goes far beyond the
celebrated theorem ascribed to the great Pythagoras by his followers.

\begin{thm}   % use the thm environment for theorems
The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals
the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{thm}

\begin{pf}    % and the pf environment for proofs
The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the squares 
of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{pf}

%% There are a number of predefined theorem-like environments in
%% ifacconf.cls:
%%
%% \begin{thm} ... \end{thm}            % Theorem
%% \begin{lem} ... \end{lem}            % Lemma
%% \begin{claim} ... \end{claim}        % Claim
%% \begin{conj} ... \end{conj}          % Conjecture
%% \begin{cor} ... \end{cor}            % Corollary
%% \begin{fact} ... \end{fact}          % Fact

%% \begin{prop} ... \end{prop}          % Proposition
%% \begin{crit} ... \end{crit}          % Criterion

Of course LaTeX manages equations through built-in macros. You may
wish to use the \textit{amstex} package for enhanced math
capabilities.

\subsection{Figures}

To insert figures, use the \textit{graphicx} package. Although other
graphics packages can also be used, \textit{graphicx} is simpler to
use. See  Fig.~\ref{fig:bifurcation} for an example.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.4cm]{bifurcation}    % The printed column width is 8.4 cm.
\caption{Bifurcation: Plot of local maxima of $x$ with damping $a$ decreasing} 
\label{fig:bifurcation}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figures must be centered, and have a caption at the bottom. 

\subsection{Tables}
Tables must be centered and have a caption above them, numbered with
Arabic numerals. See table~\ref{tb:margins} for an example.

\begin{table}[hb]
\begin{center}
\caption{Margin settings}\label{tb:margins}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
Page & Top & Bottom & Left/Right \\\hline
First & 3.5 & 2.5 & 1.5 \\
Rest & 2.5 & 2.5 & 1.5 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Final Stage}

Authors are expected to mind the margins diligently.  Papers need to
be stamped with event data and paginated for inclusion in the
proceedings. If your manuscript bleeds into margins, you will be
required to resubmit and delay the proceedings preparation in the
process.

\subsubsection{Page margins.} See table~\ref{tb:margins} for the
page margins specification. All dimensions are in \emph{centimeters}.


\subsection{PDF Creation}

All fonts must be embedded/subsetted in the PDF file. Use one of the
following tools to produce a good quality PDF file:

\subsubsection{PDFLaTeX} is a special version of LaTeX by Han The
Thanh which produces PDF output directly using Type-1 fonts instead of
the standard \textit{dvi} file. It accepts figures in JPEG, PNG, and PDF
formats, but not PostScript. Encapsulated PostScript figures can be
converted to PDF with the \textit{epstopdf} tool or with Adobe Acrobat
Distiller.

\subsubsection{Generating PDF from PostScript} is the classical way of
producing PDF files from LaTeX. The steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Produce a \textit{dvi} file by running \textit{latex} twice.
  \item Produce a PostScript (\textit{ps}) file with \textit{dvips}.
  \item Produce a PDF file with \textit{ps2pdf} or Adobe Acrobat
  Distiller.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Copyright Form}

IFAC will put in place an electronic copyright transfer system in due
course. Please \emph{do not} send copyright forms by mail or fax. More
information on this will be made available on IFAC website.


\section{Units}

Use SI as primary units. Other units may be used as secondary units
(in parentheses). This applies to papers in data storage. For example,
write ``$15\,\mathrm{Gb}/\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($100\,\mathrm{Gb}/\mathrm{in}^2$)''. 
An exception is when
English units are used as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5 in
disk drive''. Avoid combining SI and other units, such as current in
amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion
because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed
units, clearly state the units for each quantity in an equation.  The
SI unit for magnetic field strength $\mathbf{H}$ is $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$. However, if you wish to
use units of $\mathrm{T}$, either refer to magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$ or
magnetic field strength symbolized as $\mu_0\,\mathbf{H}$. Use the center dot to
separate compound units, e.g., ``$\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2$''.

\section{Helpful Hints}

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather
than symbols. As an example, write the quantity ``Magnetization'', or
``Magnetization M'', not just ``M''. Put units in parentheses. Do not
label axes only with units.  For example, write ``Magnetization
($\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$)'' or ``Magnetization ($\mathrm{A} \mathrm{m}^{-1}$)'', not just
 ``$\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$''. Do not
label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write
``Temperature ($\mathrm{K}$)'', not ``$\mbox{Temperature}/\mathrm{K}$''.

Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write ``Magnetization
($\mathrm{kA}/\mathrm{m}$)'' or ``Magnetization ($10^3 \mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$)''. Do not write
``Magnetization $(\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}) \times 1000$'' because the reader would not know
whether the axis label means $16000\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ or $0.016\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$.

\subsection{References}

Use Harvard style references (see at the end of this document). With
\LaTeX, you can process an external bibliography database 
using \textit{bibtex},\footnote{In this case you will also need the \textit{ifacconf.bst}
file, which is part of the \textit{ifaconf} package.}
or insert it directly into the reference section. Footnotes should be avoided as
far as possible.  Please note that the references at the end of this
document are in the preferred referencing style. Papers that have not
been published should be cited as ``unpublished''.  Capitalize only the
first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element
symbols.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}

Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the
text, even after they have already been defined in the
abstract. Abbreviations such as IFAC, SI, ac, and dc do not have to be
defined. Abbreviations that incorporate periods should not have
spaces: write ``C.N.R.S.'', not ``C. N. R. S.'' Do not use abbreviations
in the title unless they are unavoidable (for example, ``IFAC'' in the
title of this article).

\subsection{Equations}

Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses
flush with the right margin, as in (\ref{eq:sample}).  To make your equations more
compact, you may use the solidus ($/$), the $\exp$ function, or
appropriate exponents. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in
denominators. Punctuate equations when they are part of a sentence, as
in

\begin{equation} \label{eq:sample2}
\begin{array}{ll}
\int_0^{r_2} & F (r, \varphi ) dr d\varphi = [\sigma r_2 / (2 \mu_0 )] \\
& \cdot \int_0^{\inf} exp(-\lambda |z_j - z_i |) \lambda^{-1} J_1 (\lambda  r_2 ) J_0 (\lambda r_i ) d\lambda 
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the
equation appears or immediately following. Italicize symbols ($T$
might refer to temperature, but T is the unit tesla). Refer to
``(\ref{eq:sample})'', not ``Eq. (\ref{eq:sample})'' or ``equation
(\ref{eq:sample})'', except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation
(\ref{eq:sample}) is \ldots''.

\subsection{Other Recommendations}

Use one space after periods and colons. Hyphenate complex modifiers:
``zero-field-cooled magnetization''. Avoid dangling participles, such
as, ``Using (1), the potential was calculated'' (it is not clear who or
what used (1)). Write instead: ``The potential was calculated by using
(1)'', or ``Using (1), we calculated the potential''.

A parenthetical statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated
outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical
sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.) Avoid contractions;
for example, write ``do not'' instead of ``don' t''. The serial comma
is preferred: ``A, B, and C'' instead of ``A, B and C''.


\section{Conclusion}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review
the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the
conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work
or suggest applications and extensions.
